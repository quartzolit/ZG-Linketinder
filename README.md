# ZG-Linketinder


## 1.0
We created a MVP of a project called Linketinder

Here we have a class of Candidates and Companies. The idea of this project is to match candidates with companies based on the Candidate Skills and the Companies required skills.

The first implementation was the classes and interfaces and a single application to run those classes and tests some methods

A loader of 5 companies and 5 candidates were also implemented

## 1.1

Unit tests for Loader and Person Classed added

##1.2

FrontEnd files added


# Executing project

To execute the project you only need to run the application.groovy file. If you want to run unit tests, run the files in test folder instead

to run frontEnd project. You have to install dependencies, then use npm start to run
