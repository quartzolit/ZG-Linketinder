# ZG-Linketinder


## 1.0
We created a MVP of a project called Linketinder

Here we have a class of Candidates and Companies. The idea of this project is to match candidates with companies based on the Candidate Skills and the Companies required skills.

The first implementation was the classes and interfaces and a single application to run those classes and tests some methods

A loader of 5 companies and 5 candidates were also implemented

## 1.1

Unit tests for Loader and Person Classed added

## 1.2

FrontEnd files added. Our main file is script.ts, which is loaded on index.html file. This page is responsible to signup at Linketinder. After creating an account and login. The page will load visit-page.html page and visit-page.ts script. At this page you can manage your skills and look for available vacancy slots.

PS: There is a issue on saving the slots you approve and disapprove. It will be fixed on future patches.


## 1.3

Regex validation on form implemented and tested!

## 1.5
First, we implemented a MER and a SQL file to build the database. We fought that 9 tables were enough to deal with the situation of Mr. Sandubinha. We create a table for candidates, companies, skills, and created some support tables to associate those skills for candidates and companies's vacancies. We also created some support tables to help on swipe left/right situation. So we created the table vacancies_candidates to check which vacancy the candidate approve (the approval variable was presented on status table) and companies_candidates allow us to check if a company swiped right or left to a candidate (also using status as a parameter to check this situation).

Secondly we create a class called ConnectPostgres implementing IConnect interface, this class have 
methods to list, insert, update and delete Company, Candidate, Vacancy and Skill objects. This class uses JDBC to connect the database

## 1.6
Graddle Build Tool (To be implemented).

## 1.7
Web Crawler added (To be implemented).

## 1.9

S.O.L.I.D methods applied. On server side, the methods of Person class about skills was inserted at a proper class to preserve the idea of Single Responsability. Some interfaces were created to prepare the backend to connect to DB. Tests were refactored to make it work properly.

## 1.10

A factory design pattern was implemented bringin flexibility to database connections

## 1.11

The organization of the files was reordered following MVC pattern. To sum up the changes:
