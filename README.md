# ZG-Linketinder

We created a MVP of a project called Linketinder

Here we have a class of Candidates and Companies. The idea of this project is to match candidates with companies based on the Candidate Skills and the Companies required skills.

The first implementation was the classes and interfaces and a single application to run those classes and tests some methods

A loader of 5 companies and 5 candidates were also implemented
